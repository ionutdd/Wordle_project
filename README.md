What we did:

   In "simulator.py" can be found our solution for generating the path of finding every word from the provided dictionary. We have initially came up with an idea to give the computer the 7 best words that make up all the letters of the alphabet. Although in many cases all 7 won't be needed, this idea makes sure that every single word will have a solution. The good thing about our implementation is that it only takes about 30 seconds to generate the "solutii.txt" file. 
   
   After we finished making this idea, which is not optimal but at least runs fast, we have began developing the optimal way using Shannon's entropy which can be seen in
"Entropy.py". Unfortunately, by the time that program successfully stops running, this project will long have been past the deadline. We have tried to come up with a more efficient idea, but none of them would be optimal, which defeats the purpose of such a file. 

  The "FINAL_STAGE.py" file combines 2 programs, which are "FIRST_PART_buggy_free.py" which will let the user play the game of Wordle for the provided dictionary, and "SECOND_PART.py", which allows the user to pick a word for the computer to guess, using our method. To play Wordle, the user will simply have to type '1', and to let the computer guess the word, he will have to type '0'.
  
  All the other files show the way for how we have managed to get to our solution step by step. Overall, we had a great time working together and we have definitely learned a lot while working on this project. 
  
What we will do:
  
  Outside of the theme of the given project, we want to create a Website that will allow any user to play the Worlde game, like any other Play Worlde Website, and we want to let him type a word, for which it will be generated the path of finding that word using our method. Basically, we want to transform the "FINAL_STAGE.py" program into a Website that stands on what we have worked on this project so far.
